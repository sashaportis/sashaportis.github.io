    We're up IRL at Engelman abode in Arcata. I dreamt rachel broke up with me for another woman. Then that I flung myself at Dave Vidich and he too was involved with someone else, but at least he explained himself kindly. Then I was hugging and being comforted by Charlie and I was cursing out Rachel and it seemed like we might get together, despite the fact he's in a relationship. But that I finally feel justified in pursuing him because she broke my heart. 
Hmm, the feeling that I want what Rachel has or that the baby makes her in some way unreachable. And that I do always feel an attraction to Charlie and I'm finding it kind of exhausting to be around him with his girlfriend for so long. Like self conscious it shows or that I am envious of her which then makes me feel guilt on multiple levels, that's she's great so I should be want to get to know her and that ...I'm with Maziyar and should be only missing him and not fantasizing about anyone else, let alone a guy I've known for over 20 years and never pursued.

2 nights ago. Long nightmare. I was trapped in an old hotel in some sort of battle royal situation. We were almost home free when a woman came to me and said "you're next" and went to attack me, then I woke up. When I went back into the dream, an evil force was over the building, like a long gray cloud in the sky, it miraculously shattered and fell to the ground as red coals that weren't hot to the feet. The evil spell was broken. Then there was a guy like Martin, the only eligible bachelor amongst us, I was trying to get his attention and he went with another girl and I had to help them decorate their apartment. 
A woman tried to kill me, an evil force crumbles, and a desired man chooses someone else.
